Welcome to Cracksmain, an automated penetration testing tool designed specifically for conducting security assessments on the APIIT 
Lanka Learning Management System (LMS). Developed in response to the critical need for streamlined security testing processes, 
Cracksmain integrates various cybersecurity tools to automate the entire penetration testing lifecycle.


Purpose:
The primary purpose of Cracksmain is to facilitate comprehensive security assessments of the APIIT LMS, ensuring that it meets stringent 
compliance requirements and maintains robust defenses against potential threats. By automating the penetration testing process, 
Cracksmain aims to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of security assessments while reducing the manual effort and time required 
for testing.
